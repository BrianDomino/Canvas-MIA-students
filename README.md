# Canvas-MIA-students
Automatically emails students who have not logged into the Canvas LMS for a given number of days.

# Requirements
* You need to be a "teacher" in Canvas (or perhaps an admin).
* You'll also need a Canvas authentication token.
* You can get the course number from the URL when viewing any page in a particular course.

# To do
* Figure out how to automatic the use of Canvas email
* Automate the acquisition of the course IDs for one particular instructor
* Ultimately it would be handy to have this be time aware and not, e.g., email a student in the middle of spring break
